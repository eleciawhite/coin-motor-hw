coin-motor-hw (Motor Driver Passthrough)
=============
This repository carries the information for fabricating a board that can drive 
a motor with a MOSFET (and pass through other signals)

Some expository and description can be found here:

The original schematic can be found via DigiKey's SchemeIt (which does not 
have layout capabilities at this time):

The layout was done by Casey Kikendall.
